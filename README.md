# comp20-jspiva

- What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this git repository is to keep the code for projects and assignments I completed
in COMP 20 so that I have ACTUAL code to show anyone who might want to see what I have worked on in the past.

- What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3, where we built a server for Mapchat. I felt like we really brought
everything we had learned together in the project and were now able to build something pretty impressive.

- How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I have grown a considerable amount. I feel much more confident in my ability to be able to take an idea for a
project and turn it into an actual application, and in my ability to teach myself whatever I might need in order
to do that.

- What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

It's hard to pin down one thing, but I think the most important thing I learned in this course as far as building
an actual application is how important it is to plan ahead and proceed incrementally.

One example of this would be when picking what tools and resources you are going to use for a project. Our group
didn't decide until pretty late what APIs we were going to use to find music or what we were going to use to
style our site. As a result, some people were writing their own CSS code to enhance the design while others were using
Bootstrap templates, or one person would be reading about the Echonest API while another would be using a node wrapper for
the Spotify API. When it finally came time to finish things up, it was much more difficult to bring our work together and
collaborate because of this.

Another example would be our general plan for the site. We knew we wanted to provide concert recommendations based on
music tastes, but didn't plan our route to building something that could provide that service very carefully. As a result,
we ended up with a website that had many interesting features, like analyzing your music tastes and using the Google API
to add concert events to your calendar directly from our site, but ultimately failing to bring it together and provide
personalized recommendations.

- Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Using the Spotify API and working with users' music made me really excited to look further into using data visualization to
give users more information on their listening habits and preferences.
