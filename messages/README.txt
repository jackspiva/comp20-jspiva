Lab: Messages - README
John Spiva

To my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly.
I did not collaborate or discuss the assignment with anyone.
I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.

It is possible to request data from a different origin using XMLHttpRequest, as
we've shown in this lab (by doing just that). We can do this even though the origins
are not the same because there are ways to allow cross-origin access. You can choose
to allow certain domains to use XMLHttpRequest to get data from a source if desired.
