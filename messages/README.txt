COMP20 Lab - Messages

To my knowledge, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.
I did not collaborate or discuss the assignment with anyone.
I spent approximately 2 hours completing the assignment.

It is possible to request the data from a different origin and from our local machine, as
we have shown with this lab (we did just that). It is possible to allow cross-origin access
if desired by choosing to allow certain domains to use XMLHttpRequest on whatever
data or information you have.
